# Student_Grading
A grading program for a class
//Instructions
Write a grading program for a class with the following grading policies:
a. There are three quizzes, each graded on the basis of 10 points.
b. There is one midterm exam, graded on the basis of 100 points.
c. There is one final exam, graded on the basis of 100 points.
The final exam counts for 40% of the grade. The midterm counts for 35% of the
grade. The three quizzes together count for a total of 25% of the grade. (Do not
forget to convert the quiz scores to percentages before they are averaged in.)
Any grade of 90 or more is an A, any grade of 80 or more (but less than 90) is a
B, any grade of 70 or more (but less than 80) is a C, any grade of 60 or more (but
less than 70) is a D, and any grade below 60 is an F. The program should read in
the student’s scores and output the student’s record, which consists of three quiz
scores and two exam scores, as well as the student’s overall numeric score for the
entire course and final letter grade.
Define and use a class for the student record. The class should have instance variables
for the quizzes, midterm, final, overall numeric score for the course, and
final letter grade. The overall numeric score is a number in the range 0 to 100,
which represents the weighted average of the student’s work. The class should have
methods to compute the overall numeric grade and the final letter grade. These last
methods should be void methods that set the appropriate instance variables
